# life-stats
This is some ruby code that returns four statistics calculated from the input variable 'age'.
These stats are based on averages. The calories consumed stat is based UK average food consumption.
The sleep stat varies if you are over or under eighteen. 

I think the out put numbers are very long and could be made more pleasant to read. Inserting comma's or making the nubers more readable is a next change to make.
